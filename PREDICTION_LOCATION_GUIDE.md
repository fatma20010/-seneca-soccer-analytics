# 🎯 Where to Find Your ML Match Predictions

## ❗ Important: You're Looking at the Wrong Tab!

### What You're Currently Seeing:
- **"ML Scoring" Tab** = Team performance analysis (possession %, pass accuracy, player ratings)
- This shows 0% possession because it's placeholder/mock data

### Where Your Neural Network Predictions Are:
- **"Match Prediction" Tab** = Neural network outcome predictions (Home Win, Draw, Away Win)
- This is a separate tab specifically for your `neural_net_model.pkl` predictions

## 🔍 How to Find Your Predictions:

1. **In the Analysis Results**, look for these tabs:
   ```
   [Overview] [Video Analysis] [ML Scoring] [🎯 Match Prediction] [Fan Sentiment] [AI Insights]
   ```

2. **Click on "Match Prediction"** (the one with the target icon 🎯)

3. **You should see:**
   - Large prediction like "Home Win" or "Draw" 
   - Probability bars showing percentages
   - Pie chart with colored sections
   - Model information showing which method was used

## 🧪 Test with Mock Data:

To test immediately:
1. Go to the Analyze page
2. Upload any video file
3. Choose "Quick Analysis" (mock mode)
4. Wait for completion
5. Click the **"Match Prediction"** tab
6. You should see: "Home Win" with 65% confidence

## 🔧 If You Still Don't See Predictions:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12 → Console tab)
   - Look for messages like "Match prediction data: ..."
   - Look for "Analysis results received: ..."

2. **Verify Tab Order:**
   ```
   Overview → Video Analysis → ML Scoring → 🎯 Match Prediction → Fan Sentiment → AI Insights
   ```

## 📊 What the Prediction Tab Shows:

```
Neural Network Match Prediction
--------------------------------
        HOME WIN                 <- Big prediction
   (Confidence: 65.0%)

Home Win    ████████████ 65.0%   <- Progress bars
Draw        ███ 20.0%
Away Win    ██ 15.0%

[Pie Chart showing proportions]

Model Information:
- Model Type: fallback/neural_network
- Features Used: 16
- Confidence: 65.0%
```

## 🚀 The Difference:

- **ML Scoring Tab** = How well teams performed (speeds, passes, etc.)
- **Match Prediction Tab** = Who will win the match (your neural network output)

**Click the "Match Prediction" tab to see your neural network results! 🎯**
